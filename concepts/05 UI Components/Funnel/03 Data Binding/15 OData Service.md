To bind the Funnel to data provided by an OData service, use the [ODataStore](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/ODataStore '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/ODataStore/').

#include data-binding-examples-odata with {
    key: "'Id'"
}

As you may notice, in the previous code, the **ODataStore** is not declared explicilty. Instead, it is wrapped in the [DataSource](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/DataSource '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/') instance. That is because the Funnel requires [pagination](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/DataSource/1%20Configuration/paginate.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/#paginate') to be off in order to prevent data from partitioning. Other than that, the **DataSource** provides wide data-processing capabilities. For example, it can filter data.

#include data-binding-examples-odata-filter with {
    key: "'Id'"
}

If you target .NET for your backend API, be sure to check out <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/403394/backend-web-api-service?utm_source=js.devexpress.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=xaf&utm_content=funnel-odata-service" target="_blank">Web API Service</a> and register your <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/security-api-free?utm_source=js.devexpress.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=xaf&utm_content=funnel-odata-service" target="_blank">free copy today</a>. The Solution Wizard scaffolds an OData v4 Web API Service (.NET 6+) with integrated authorization & CRUD operations powered by EF Core and our XPO ORM library. You can use OAuth2, JWT or custom authentication strategies alongside tools like Postman or Swagger (OpenAPI) for API testing.

The built-in Web API Service also filters out secured server data based on permissions granted to users. Advanced/enterprise functions include audit trail, endpoints to download reports, file attachments, check validation, obtain localized captions, etc. 

To use the free Solution Wizard (which creates the Web API Service) run the Universal Component Installer from the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/ClientCenter/DownloadManager/?utm_source=js.devexpress.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=xaf&utm_content=funnel-odata-service" target="_blank">DevExpress Download Manager</a>.
